			<strong> Description</strong>
			<p>This web application is a Synchronous Chat Service. 
			The first tier of the application is the client's interface to the chatroom. This
			will be implemented using Java Server Faces to allow dynamic creation of html at runtime.
			To stop the entire page needing to be refreshed every time there is an update, ajax will be
			used to allow partial page updates, providing a more friendly user experience. This will
			run on a Java web server, most likely to be tomcat. The middle or second tier of the application will
			also run on the web server an act as the communication layer between the first and third tiers.
			This tier will function as a servlet and will alter the requests sent to it by the first tier and
			pass them onto the third tier. This tier acts like a XMPP client. The third tier is essentially 
			the XMPP server, which will relay chat messages back through to the tiers to the client.

		<br>
		The account page allows the user to create an account for accessing the chat rooms.  
		This will enhance the users experience by offering them the ability to retain their identity across many sessions.
		The page is set up to operate on an HTML5 form.  The user enters their requested username, on moving away from
		that field the server will check whether that username is available.  If not the user will be informed, and 
		offered the chance to create a different username.  The user then enters a password into an HTML5 password type text entry.  
		They then are required to re-enter the password, this will be checked to see it matches, on the user moving off that element.
		  They then enter their email address, this must be of the type set by the HTML5 email type.  The user then re-enters this, and again
		  the server checks whether the two entries match when the user moves off that element.  The user then enters their date of birth, into
		  an HTML5 date type input field.  They can describe themselves in one sentence if they wish.<\br>
		  
		  Currently the information in the profile page is for account creation, in order to allow the user to choose a username.  However, 
		  we have a potential plan to develop a profile page that other users can click on to see information about a given user.
		  If we do include this option, the tick box contained within the account creation page, (currently obsolete) would then allow
		  a user to enter details about themselves, but choose to have them hidden from other users if they wish.
		  
		  There are also 3 buttons on this page.  "about project" brings the user to this report page.
		  "register" sends the details to be attached to the database.  "cancel" takes the user back to the main entrance page, from wher
		  they can enter the chat room as a guest if they wish.
