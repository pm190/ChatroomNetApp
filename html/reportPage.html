			<strong> Description</strong>
			<p>This web application is a Synchronous Chat Service. 
			The first tier of the application is the client's interface to the chatroom. This
			will be implemented using Java Server Faces to allow dynamic creation of html at runtime.
			To stop the entire page needing to be refreshed every time there is an update, ajax will be
			used to allow partial page updates, providing a more friendly user experience. This will
			run on a Java web server, most likely to be tomcat. The middle or second tier of the application will
			also run on the web server an act as the communication layer between the first and third tiers.
			This tier will function as a servlet and will alter the requests sent to it by the first tier and
			pass them onto the third tier. This tier acts like a XMPP client. The third tier is essentially 
			the XMPP server, which will relay chat messages back through to the tiers to the client.
